# Quote Generator

## Overview

The Quote Generator is a simple web application that dynamically displays quotes using Vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation. This project is designed to serve as a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) with further enhancements to expand its functionality.

## Features

### MVP: Generating Quotes

[x] **Quote Display:** The application starts with a list of predefined quotes. It displays one quote on the screen at a time.
[x] **Random Quote Button:** A button is provided that, when clicked, displays a new random quote from the list.

### Required Enhancements

1. **Add More Quotes:**

   [X] Expand the existing array of quotes with additional quotes to enhance the variety.

2. **Animations:**

   - Implement a simple fade-in animation effect when a new quote is displayed, providing a smoother user experience.

3. **API Integration:**
   [X] Integrate with an external quote API (such as [Quotes REST API](https://quotes.rest/)) to fetch random quotes dynamically, ensuring a fresh and diverse set of quotes with each interaction.
